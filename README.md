# COMP337 Lang Parser

The two extensions we implemented were type checking and code transforms. To use our main.py, type main.py and optionally add a tag to run a certain part of the interpreter, then enter the directory for the test cases you wish to run. For the tags, you can either enter '-i' to run just the interpreter, '-p' to run just the parser, or '-t' to just run code transforms for the test cases at the given directory. Run with python3.
